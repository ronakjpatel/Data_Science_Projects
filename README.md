# Small but exceptionally valuable code snippets :fire: :gift:

## Aim of this Repo 

In this repository, I will add small but very important code snippets which would explain very critical data science's concepts. I will try to make visualizations to understand concepts better. 

 :medal_military:Understanding of this concepts help me and you to understand the AI algorithms better.

Thanks heaps.
